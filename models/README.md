# Models

Saved model weights and checkpoints.

## Files

- **`best_custom_model_fast.keras`** (48MB) - Fast-training custom CNN model
- **`best_model.keras`** (45MB) - Best baseline model checkpoint

## Note

Large model files (>100MB) are excluded from Git per `.gitignore`. These can be regenerated by running the training code in the notebooks.

To regenerate:
- Run Problem 2 in `Milestone_02.ipynb` for baseline models
- Run Problem 3 in `Milestone_02.ipynb` for custom CNN models

## Model Architecture

See the respective notebook cells for architecture details and hyperparameters.
